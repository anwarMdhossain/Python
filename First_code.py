'''Python, for example, can be executed as either a compiled program or as an interpreted language in interactive mode. 
So basically, the python program is first compiled and then interpreted. The compilation part is hidden and we believe 
that it is only an interpreted language. The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code 
and internally this byte code gets converted by the interpreter (python virtual machine). 
And this compiled part gets deleted by the python as soon as you execute your code so that programmers donâ€™t get into complexity.'''
